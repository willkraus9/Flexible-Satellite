# purpose
simulate a cantaliever beam in Python; deflection ignores gravity (since deflections are in the radial direction and the beam is viewed from a top-down perspective)

# TODO: 
- figure out how to get force at different points
    DONE (change f variable and location)
- plot over time 
- label plot    
    DONE (easy)
- convert, reduce
- Euler-Bernoulli videos + integrate???

2. Graphing beam deflection in Python
